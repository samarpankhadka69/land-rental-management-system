This project is a Python-based land rental management system for "Techno Property Nepal." It allows users to rent and return land using a text-based interface. Land details are stored in a `.txt` file, and the program updates availability after each transaction. It generates invoices for both renting and returning (with fines if late), using separate modules for reading, writing, and operations. The system includes input validation, exception handling, and was tested for functionality and accuracy.
